## Hi there 👋

My name is Wang Leng (Maurice).

At my day job, I am a TypeScript + ⚛️ React developer.

However, at night, I sometimes do 🦀 Rust personal projects on the side.

### 🦀 Rust

* My current active toy project is [knap-editor](https://github.com/yamgent/knap-editor), an amateur text editor written in Rust following the hecto tutorial.
* I used to do game jams using Rust, like for [Mini Jam 139](https://github.com/yamgent/mini-jam-139-fae-coin) and [Rusty Jam 2](https://github.com/yamgent/rusty-jam-2-dog-chicken).
* I also used to do random small OSS contributions, the most significant one being the now-defunct [stc project](https://github.com/dudykr/stc), that tried to rewrite `tsc` in Rust.
